# Dalwa Press Agent

## Core Workflow

Use this skill to continue work in the Dalwa Press repo without rediscovering the project shape.

1. Treat `backend/` as the Laravel API and `frontend/` as the Vue 3/Vite app.
2. Preserve the existing role portals:
   - Admin/Operator: `/administrator`
   - Author: `/author`
   - Editor: `/editor`
3. Prefer existing page/layout patterns before inventing UI. Admin, Author, and Editor dashboards use the same admin-style shell: sidebar, navbar, horizontal nav, footer, CSS theme variables, and `simplebar-vue`.
4. Keep behavior scoped. Do not refactor public landing pages while changing dashboards unless explicitly asked.
5. Before changing shared auth, routing, migrations, or submission behavior, read `references/project-map.md`.

## Backend Conventions

- Routes live in `backend/routes/api.php`.
- Auth uses Sanctum token auth through `AuthController@login`.
- Login roles currently include `Admin`, `Operator`, `Author`, and `Editor`.
- Seeder is expected to print copy-paste login credentials after `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`.
- Submission statuses are: `submitted`, `under_review`, `revision`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `published`.
- Author submission endpoints are under `/api/author`.
- Editor endpoints are under `/api/editor` and must only expose assigned submissions.
- Admin/Operator editor assignment uses:
  - `GET /api/editors`
  - `POST /api/submissions/{submission}/assign-editors`

When adding backend behavior:

- Add relationship methods to models instead of ad hoc queries in controllers when the relationship is reused.
- Use role checks in portal controllers (`Author`, `Editor`) and keep Admin/Operator-only operations guarded.
- For editor reviews, fill reviewer identity from the authenticated editor user, not free-form frontend input.

## Frontend Conventions

- Router lives in `frontend/src/router/index.js`.
- Axios instance lives in `frontend/src/axios.js`.
- Shared asset helpers live in `frontend/src/utils/asset.js`.
- Admin layout components live in `frontend/src/components/layouts/admin`.
- Author layout components live in `frontend/src/components/layouts/author`.
- Editor layout components live in `frontend/src/components/layouts/editor`.

For dashboard pages:

- Use the current admin visual language: `var(--bg-card)`, `var(--bg-input)`, `var(--border)`, `var(--text-heading)`, `var(--text-body)`, `var(--text-muted)`, `var(--color-accent)`.
- Use Material Symbols already present in the project for icons.
- Use `vue-multiselect` for searchable selects in admin forms, especially editor assignment.
- Avoid wrapping `VueMultiselect` in a native `<label>`; use `div.field` plus a text label to avoid click/select bugs.
- For submit buttons, add a loading state, disable while saving, and update local reactive data from the API response when possible instead of reloading the whole page.

## Validation

Do not run testing, build, lint, preview, browser verification, or other validation commands automatically after changes. The user prefers to test manually.

If validation would normally be useful, mention the suggested command briefly in the final response without running it, unless the user explicitly asks you to run checks.

## Reference

Read `references/project-map.md` when the task touches roles, routes, dashboard layout, submission review, editor assignment, seed users, or known pitfalls.
